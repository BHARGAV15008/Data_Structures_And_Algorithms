// Graph is represented as G = (V, E);
// Graph is one of the closed tree;
// It used to networking ;
// Building combination of edge and node (vertex);
// Every edge has own weights;
// Directed Edge: Edge with direction (Arrow), one way connection;
// Undirected Edge: Edge without direction (Arrow), two way connection;
// Directed Graph: All edges are directed;
// Undirected Graph: All edges are undirected;

// Graph represented in two ways:
//  - Adjacency List: Mark the nodes with the list of its neighbours;
//  - Adjacency Matrix Aij: 1 for an edge between i and j, 0 otherwise;
//  - Edge Sets: Make pair of two vertices if edge between their;
//  - Cost Adjacency Matrix Aij: Write cost on Aij position when i and j connected, -1 otherwise;

// Graph traversal in two ways:
//  - Breadth First Search (BFS): Queue used to implements;
//  - Depth First Search (DFS): Stack used to implements;
