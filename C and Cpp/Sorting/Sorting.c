    * Internal SA: All data loaded into memory;
    * External SA: All data are not loaded into memory;
    * Adaptive: Already sorted data takes less time;

-----   Types of Sorting Algorithms   -----
    * Bubble Sort:
        - Time Complexity: O(n^2);
        - Stable Algorithm;
        - Inplace Sorting Algorithm;
        - It's not Adaptive, but possible to make;
        - Iterative Sorting;

    * Insertion Sort:
        - Time Complexity: O(n^2) - worst and average, O(n) - best;
